VOICE ASSISTANT 

I have created a Voice Assistant using Speech recognition in #python language which will run some basic linux commands on Web Interface .

Languages used in creating this Web Interface are :
# HTML and CSS - for front end programming
# Python based CGI programming - for back end programming.

In order to execute Linux commands we need CGI support with Apache httpd web server in Linux OS. And we can access that web interface from Windows OS.
